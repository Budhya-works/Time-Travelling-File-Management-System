# Time-Travelling-File-Management-System
The "Time-Travelling File Management System" is a simplified, in-memory version control system implemented entirely in C++, inspired by tools like Git. It is designed to explore advanced data structures and algorithmic concepts by building a fully functional mini version control system without relying too much on external libraries.
